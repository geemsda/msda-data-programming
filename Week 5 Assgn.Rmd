This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```

```{r matrices}
A = matrix(c(1,-1,-1,-1),nrow=2,ncol =2,byrow = T)
B = matrix(c(2,3,-1,-2),nrow=2,ncol =2,byrow = T)
C = matrix(c(1,0,0,0),nrow=2,ncol =2,byrow = T)
D = matrix(c(0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1),nrow=3,ncol =3,byrow = T)
E = matrix(c(1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0),nrow=3,ncol =3,byrow = T)
```
```{r indempotent: A squared = A}
all.equal (A,(a2 = A %*% A))
all.equal (B,(B2 = B %*% B))
all.equal (C,(C2 = C %*% C))
all.equal (D,(D2 = D %*% D))
all.equal (E,(E2 = E %*% E))
```
```{r othogonal: A tranpose = A inverse}
all.equal(t(A),solve(A))
all.equal(t(B),solve(B))
all.equal(t(C),solve(C))
all.equal(t(D),solve(D))
all.equal(t(E),solve(E))

```
