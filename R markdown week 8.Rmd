R Code Assignment - Week 8
========================================================
QUESTION 1:

The following  code does an element by element addition of two vectors v and w.

```{r}
v <- 2:8
v
w <- seq (5, 35, 5)
w
for (i in 1:7) {
  s  <- v[i] + w[i]
  print(s)

```

Alternately, the R code v+w, would have return the same results of adding each element of v to the correspoding element of w (provided they are of the same length, otherwise R repeats the element of the shortes vector to complete the addition)

QUESTION 2

The following code counts the number of "heads" in a vector of coin toss results


```{r}

g <-c("heads","heads","heads","heads","heads","tails","heads")
t <- 1
c <- 0
while (g[t] != "tails" &&  t <= length(g)) 
{
     t = t + 1
     c = c + 1
}
g
print(c)
```

QUESTION 3

Totals all odd numbers bewteen 1 and 100

```{r}
r <- 0
for (i in 1:100)
{
   
     r = r + (ifelse (i%%2 == 0,0,i))
     
}
print (r)
}
